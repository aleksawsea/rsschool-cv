## Summary

I've been working as a QA specialist for 2.5 years now and I've enjoyed it at the beginning, but I feel like I'm starting to lose interest and enthusiasm. I've always wanted to be passionate about my work and I think that it's in my power to change my occupation when I feel that I need to move on. When I started my job in the current company, I was a graduate of Chemistry faculty from BSU and had no experience in testing, so I had to learn everything from scratch. Now I want to learn frontend from scratch as well. I'm persistent, diligent and ambitious, when I know, what I want and when I like it - that's why I believe that in the future I can become a frontend developer with the help of RS-School!
